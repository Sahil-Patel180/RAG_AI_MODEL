A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI model. This repository contains the code and resources to deploy and run a RAG-based AI agent.

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, designed to provide accurate and context-aware responses. By combining a retrieval system (which fetches relevant documents) with a generative model (which synthesizes an answer), this agent can answer questions by drawing from an external knowledge base.

This repository is structured to be production-ready, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and reliability.

## Features

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Leverages external documents to provide informed and accurate answers, reducing hallucinations.
* **Production-Ready:** Code is structured for deployment, including necessary configurations and scripts.
* **Scalable:** Designed to handle a large knowledge base and significant query volume.
* **(Add other features here):** For example, what kind of vector database does it use? What language model is it built on (e.g., Llama, GPT, Mistral)?
