# RAG AI Model

Welcome to my repository of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) projects. This collection showcases my skills in building advanced AI models that can query external knowledge bases to provide accurate, context-aware answers.

## Projects

This repository contains the following project:

### 1. Production-Ready RAG AI Agent

* **Folder:** `[Production-Ready RAG AI Agent](Production-Ready%20RAG%20AI%20Agent)`
* **Description:** This project implements a production-ready RAG model. It combines a retrieval system (to find relevant documents) with a generative model (to synthesize an answer) to respond to user queries.
* **Focus:** The application is designed to be scalable and efficient, capable of drawing from an external knowledge base to reduce hallucinations and provide informed, accurate responses.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary language used for the application logic.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4, Llama)
* **AI Frameworks:** (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex)
* **Vector Databases:** (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone)
* **UI Framework:** (e.g., Streamlit, Flask)

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/Sahil-Patel180/RAG_AI_MODEL.git](https://github.com/Sahil-Patel180/RAG_AI_MODEL.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a project folder:**
    ```
    cd RAG_AI_MODEL/Production-Ready RAG AI Agent
    ```
3.  **Use the Application:**
    * Install the required dependencies (usually from a `requirements.txt` file):
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    * Set up your environment variables (like API keys) in a `.env` file.
    * Run the main application file (e.g., `streamlit run app.py` or `python app.py`).
